To-Do-List
[x] check energy computation for Ep
[] consider changing to std::vector
[x] implement time-stepping, consider creating extra member function for first timestep
[x] implement correction for dam_break (ignore boundary)
[x] need to correct zero acceleration interaction between particles
[x] implement velocity damping at boundary
[x] correct SPH::PerturbParticle() loop sequence in base
[x] merge serial with master
[x] reorganise comments in SPH::AccelComputation for base
[x] rewrite section about I/O in further improvements
[] serial : change neighbour variable in SPH.h
[] serial : change vector assignment in AccelComputation, use pointer, check first though - don't think it's an issue

Optimisation Ideas
[x] optimisation of Ek computation loop (v(x_1)' * v(x_2)) in SPH::EnergyComputation
[x] computation of r(i,j) = -r(j,i), exploit symmetry
[x] create particle neighbour map (for each i, map = [list of j], where q(i,j) < 1)

parallel-div-dev (notes for refactoring)
- SPH::RunSimulation()
[x] MapNeighbour needs rewrite to deal with ghost pairs and self-symmetry
[] a mapping from a -> a_G is required for MPI_Manager::Comm_Array_L2G, needs to be done, uses id-array
[x] Deal with initialisation of inter_set
[] need to communicate g_p, g_rho
